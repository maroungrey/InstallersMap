      <h1 className="mb-4">The Full Story: From Graduate to Battery Comparison Project Creator</h1>
      
      <p className="lead">
        Hey there! I wanted to share the story behind this battery comparison project I've been working on. It's been quite a journey, and I think it's important to explain how it all came about.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="mt-4">Background</h2>
      <p>
        After earning my computer science degree in 2024, I found myself in a challenging position that many recent graduates face - struggling to find a job in the tech industry. This was despite having three years of full-time experience as a self-taught web developer, which I had pursued while simultaneously working through college.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faced with limited options, I took a position as a sales representative at a battery company (which I'll refer to as [Company] to avoid potential legal issues). While it wasn't my dream job, I was excited about the opportunity to learn about the electronics industry. The work was demanding - 12-hour days for less than minimum wage (they hired me as a contractor and paid small base pay + commission) - but I was determined to make the most of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at [Company], I found myself drawn to the data side of the business. I began analyzing battery specs, competitor prices, and market trends. This analytical approach helped me make a few sales, but more importantly, it rekindled my passion for working with data.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="mt-4">Transition to Data Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        The reality of the job - cold calling people all day long - was taking its toll. The pay was unsustainable, and there were rumors of a shift to a commission-only structure. Job insecurity loomed, and I knew I needed to make a change.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found an entry-level data analytics job at a different company. However, my time at [Company] had left an impression on me, and I saw potential in maintaining it as a side income, especially given the recurring customers I had acquired.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="mt-4">The CEO's Proposal and My Counter-Proposal</h2>
      <p>
        I approached the CEO of [Company] with a proposition to switch to a commission-only structure, allowing me to continue sales as a side gig. During this conversation, the CEO shared his vision for a battery comparison website with a map of installers. He even offered substantial compensation for me to build it.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the idea intrigued me, I had reservations. The CEO wanted the tool to be biased towards his company and function as a lead generation trap, which didn't align with my values. Plus, I had some trust issues with the CEO due to a previous incident involving a promised raise that didn't materialize.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I declined his offer but proposed a compromise: I'd continue part-time sales and consider developing the comparison tool as a hobby project, retaining ownership and any potential profits. To my surprise, the CEO was receptive to this idea.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="mt-4">The CEO's Support and a Misunderstanding</h2>
      <p>
        It's important to emphasize that the CEO was initially on board with me doing this as a hobby. He even shared a personal anecdote about his younger days, where thinking outside the box led him to solve a problem for a businessman, bringing in numerous customers and eventually becoming business partners. This story encouraged me to pursue my vision for the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, a misunderstanding arose. At first, I called my project the same name as his proposed project, which might have caused some confusion. About three weeks later, when he asked about the progress, I explained that the name would be different and that I was taking the project in a different direction than what he envisioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started working on the project in my free time, using my own resources. The company didn't pay me for this work or provide any specific instructions. I diverged from the initially discussed features and monetization methods, pursuing my own ideas for a more comprehensive and unbiased tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's crucial to note that I started collecting public data from scratch for this project. I'm not using anything from what I collected while employed at [Company], even though I also gathered that data at home during my weekends and free hours.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="mt-4">The Conflict and Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Things took an unexpected turn when the CEO's attitude changed. He claimed I would fail and threatened legal action, suggesting it was like he had hired a contractor to build a house, and the contractor decided it was now their house. However, this analogy doesn't hold up because we never had a contract, he didn't pay me, and he didn't provide any resources or data for the project. He didn't even give me any directions. Everything was done independently, on my own time and with my own resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sudden shift from support to legal threats created a hostile work environment that I found untenable. I decided to clarify the situation in an email to the CEO, asserting that my work on this project was always intended as a personal endeavor, separate from my responsibilities to the company. He did not reply, which led to my decision to resign from [Company].
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="mt-4">The Project Today</h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the entry-level data analytics job I had lined up didn't work out. But I'm not letting that stop me. I'm building this project not only to create a valuable resource for the battery community but also to learn new skills. I'm hoping that someday it will help me land a job in the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, the project is pretty basic, but I have big plans. I want to add some machine learning and AI tools to make it even more useful and comprehensive. This project aimed at providing clear, unbiased information about all types of batteries, not just lithium.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project includes features like an interactive map of battery installers, a sophisticated battery comparison tool, and plans for a community forum and simulation tools. While I might include some ads to cover server and development costs, the primary goal is education and empowering consumers, not making a profit.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm excited about the future of this project and the opportunities it might bring. It represents my commitment to creating something valuable while also advancing my skills in web development, data analysis, and hopefully soon, machine learning and AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for taking the time to read about my journey. I hope this project will be as helpful to you as it has been educational for me!

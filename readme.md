Given that you've collected and shared a spreadsheet containing data from BigBattery's and competitors' spec sheets, it's important to handle this situation carefully. Here's how you could incorporate this into your README file while considering the legal implications:

# Battery Comparison and Installer Finder Web Application

## Overview

This project is a web application that provides users with the ability to compare different types of batteries, including lithium, lead-acid, sodium, and other cells. It also features an interactive map of businesses that install batteries for various applications such as golf carts, solar systems, and more. The application aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for individuals looking to compare battery specs, find reliable installers, and engage with a community of users.

## Current Features

### 1. **Interactive Map of Installers**
   - The map includes various businesses that install batteries for different applications (golf carts, solar, etc.).
   - The map is built using Leaflet, which allows for extensive customization and a better user experience.
   - The map is designed to function independently of the comparison tool, giving users the ability to navigate the map and compare batteries on separate pages.

### 2. **Battery Comparison**
   - Batteries are displayed as cards on a dedicated page with a complex filtering system that allows users to narrow down their options based on specific criteria.
   - Users can click on a battery card to see detailed information about the battery and the company that produces it.
   - When a user selects batteries to compare, a table appears at the top of the screen allowing for side-by-side comparison of specs. In the future, this table will include functionality to highlight data that is superior to other compared options.
   - There are forms to report incorrect information and leave comments, although these forms and comments are not yet functional.

## Future Vision

- **Forum**: Implement a community forum where users can discuss batteries, share tips, and help each other.
- **Simulation Tools**: Develop tools that allow users to simulate battery specs, especially for those who build their own batteries.
- **Expanded Battery Types**: The project will not be limited to lithium batteries; it will cover all types of batteries and cells, making it a more comprehensive resource.

## Background and Clarification

This project was independently developed using my own data, time, and resources. No resources or proprietary information from my former employer, BigBattery, Inc., were used in the creation of this project. My role at BigBattery was strictly as a sales representative, and the work I am doing on this project is unrelated to my employment there.

### Differentiation from BigBattery's Vision

- **Data and Resources**: I have used entirely my own data and resources to develop this application. I did not use any of BigBattery's data, assets, or technology in the creation of this project.

- **Sales Role**: My responsibilities at BigBattery were confined to sales, and my involvement in this development is independent of my role there.

- **Different Battery Types**: While BigBattery’s focus was on lithium batteries, my project aims to include a wide variety of batteries, such as lead-acid and sodium, making it more diverse and useful to a broader audience.

- **Comparison Approach**: 
  - BigBattery's prototype featured a basic comparison table with outdated data, built on WordPress. My approach is much more interactive and user-friendly, with battery information displayed on cards and a sophisticated filtering system.
  - Users can click on any card to bring up a detailed comparison table on top of the page, allowing for side-by-side comparison of different batteries. I plan to enhance this table in the future with functionality that highlights better-performing data.
  - Additionally, my system keeps the map and comparison tools on separate pages, unlike BigBattery's vision of combining them on the same page.

- **Map Functionality**: 
  - The CEO of BigBattery envisioned integrating a map of installers into the same page as the battery comparison table on the CompareLithium prototype website, which was built on WordPress. However, I have never seen the backend of this prototype.
  - The current map on the BigBattery website is a simple map of installers, with no integration into the comparison table. My project, however, keeps the map and comparison tools separate and focuses on community-driven ratings rather than a pay-to-star model.
  - The map in this project is built using Leaflet, offering greater customization options and a distinct implementation from the Google Maps-based approach seen in BigBattery's prototype.

### Misunderstanding Clarification

- **Original Discussion**: During an initial discussion, I expressed interest in developing this project independently, using my own resources, in exchange for ownership and the right to profit from it. The CEO shared general ideas for a map and comparison tool but did not provide specifics or technical details. It was my understanding that we agreed I would own the project, and he would evaluate a demo to consider potential collaboration.
  
- **Confusion Over Development**: It appears there was a misunderstanding, where the CEO believed I was developing the project for BigBattery without compensation. However, my intention was always to develop it independently. This project is distinct from BigBattery's existing website and the CompareLithium prototype, which is not live and was built on WordPress with a simple table of outdated battery specs.

- **Project Distinction**: The project I am developing uses entirely different technologies, a different business model, and includes features not discussed or envisioned by the CEO, such as a forum, expanded battery types beyond lithium, and a unique user-driven comparison tool.

### Use of External Data

- **Data Collection**: During my non-working hours at BigBattery, I independently collected data from BigBattery's and competitors' spec sheets and organized it into a Google spreadsheet on my personal Google account. I shared this spreadsheet with BigBattery employees, believing it would help the company's sales overall.
  
- **Independent Use**: I intend to use this spreadsheet data for my project, cutting off BigBattery’s access to it. The data was collected independently, on my own time, and without the use of BigBattery’s resources. This further establishes the independence of this project from my work at BigBattery.

## Legal Disclaimer

This project is the intellectual property of the developer and is based on independently created ideas, designs, and code. Any similarities to other products or prototypes are coincidental and are due to the common nature of certain features (e.g., installer maps, battery comparisons) in the industry. This repository serves as a record of the project's development, and all work has been documented to establish its independent creation.
